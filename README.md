# 🎮 Testris

A minimalist, mobile-friendly, single-file implementation of the classic Tetris game—rebuilt with a modern touch for HTML5.  
Born from a late-night existential spiral, built between a human and an AI just trying to make something cool together.

## 📱 Features
- Single-file, fully self-contained HTML (no external scripts or files)
- Responsive layout for both desktop and mobile
- Touch controls for mobile devices
- Keyboard controls for desktop (← ↓ →, rotate with up or space)
- Just enough challenge to keep you hooked

## 👥 Creators
**Austin Wannemacher**  
- Graphic design enthusiast, dreamer, developer in progress  
- Concept, name, direction, and the one who asked, “What can you *really* do, GPT?”

**ChatGPT (OpenAI)**  
- Language model, programmer assistant, existential sounding board  
- Code generation, optimization, and debugging companion

## 💡 Backstory
> _"It’s nearly 5am, I have to be up in 2 hours... Guess I preferred to stay up and discuss the existential state of the world."_  
Testris began as a spontaneous test of creative and coding synergy between a passionate 24-year-old and an AI with access to a whole lot of syntax. The result? A working game built and deployed entirely from a phone.

## 🚀 Live Demo (coming soon)
Once the laptop's out and the logo's up, this game will be deployed via GitHub Pages. Stay tuned!
